Today I ran (most of) the 5k Panerathon race. Felt pretty good for having participated in that, though I still wish I could finish an official 5k without walking. I can say (thanks to my phone) that my first kilometer is probably what killed me. As it interrupted my music to give me my pace and distance etc, I found out that I had covered the first kilometer of the race in 6:04(!), that's a crazy pace for me. If I had maintained that pace I would have cut about 5 minutes off my best 5k to date. Well, I still finished, and had fun, and that's really all that matters.
