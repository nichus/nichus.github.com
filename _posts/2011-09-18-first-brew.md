Today marks my first foray into the wild world of brewing beer. I can honestly say that, due to my own desires alone, I would probably have never attempted this process. However, the planets seemed to align, and in the span of a 24 hour window my wife mentioned that she thought it would be a great idea, and [Groupon](http://groupon.com/) featured a special from [Midwest Supplies](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/) with a starter equipment kit, and an ingredient kit for $64, plus shipping. With those two together, it was just a matter of waiting for the Fedex driver and a free weekend before the fun began in earnest.

Today, I stopped by the local Homebrew shop ([The Bald Brewer](http://baldbrewer.com/)) and picked up a few items that I felt should have been essentials, including an auto-siphon, a tube for my hydrometer test, a hose clamp (might be redundant with the auto-siphon), and a pile of amber bottles. Granted, of that list, I only used one of those items today, guess I was planning too far in advance. I also found out that there is a local homebrew club, who apparently meet the second wednesday of every month (missed it by that much). I believe I was told they were named something related to IPA, but that’s all I got added to my phone calendar. Also, can’t seem to find them online. *shrug*

When I got home, my wife put out daughter to bed for her nap, and then she crushed some grains while I washed and sanitized some pots and utensils. First lesson: Never dump your sanitizer solution! You always realize that there is at least one more item that needs to be sanitized, or re-sanitized. Then I started heating 5 gallons of water (split 2.5 each) in our two large pots. Second Lesson: You need more water than the size of the batch you’re working with, I needed about 5.5 today. One for the wart, the other for the fermentation bucket (no, unfortunately I don’t have an 8 gallon pot, nor would my stovetop have enough room for it below our microwave). When the pre-wart reached 160 degrees, I added my muslin bag of crushed grains, and I let that steep for 35 minutes (recipe called for 30) on the burner, and an additional 10 off. Next I added my LME, and returned the pot to the burner.

I returned the burner to about 80% to get the wart up to a boil. After a few (10?) minutes, the wart reached a boil, and I reintroduced my muslin bag; this time with an ounce of cascade hops pellets, to the pot. Meanwhile, I’m still waiting for a boil to break out in the pot of water that simply needed to be sanitized. It wasn’t too much later that I experienced my hot break. I knew it was coming, but freaked out anyway. Third Lesson: sanitize your water ahead of time, because waiting until halfway through your wart boil to have “clean” water is not good planning.

Since my water pot finally boiled, I burnt through one of my bags of wart cooling ice to bring that down to temperature, with a few minutes to spare before it was time to add my aroma hops (1oz Fuggle @ 2minutes) to the muslin. I let my wart finish it’s boil, removed the muslin hops bag, and transferred the stockpot into a sink full of 10lbs of ice plus water. Five minutes later, and the ice was all melted, and I was hoofing it to 7-11 to pick up an additional 10lb bag of ice. Back in time for the first agitation at 15 minutes post boil, dumped half the water in the sink, added the new bag of ice and returned the pot to the sink.

I tested the temperature of the wart 10 minutes later, and found that it had cooled to 67oF, well below our 80oF target. Since I was at target, I decided it was time to wake up my dry yeast. So, I poured the packed into a sanitized measuring cup with 1cup of 96oF water, and started it’s 10minute timer. That started, I poured the cooled wart through a fine collander and into the Fermentation bucket, added all my sanitized water, only to realize that I had come up a half gallon short (see Lesson 2).

Not sure why, but I am under the impression that once you start to wake yeast up (especially when they don’t have food) you need to get them into their foodstuffs soon. So I started microwaving what my rushed mind thought would be enough water (maybe a pint, yeah I suck) and brought that to a boil (17 minute later). I realized my shortcoming while it was in the microwave (and thanks to some wifely insight) and decided that since I still have a bottle of purified (not sanitized) water, after the bowl of water is boiling, I would add purified water to the bowl, then add to the fermentation bucket however much I need. If my beer doesn’t turn out, I’m looking here as the cause first.

Since my fermentation bucket has it’s requisite 5 gallons, I scooped out a cup with my sanitized measuring cup and poured that into my hydrometer tube for a reading. Stirred up my yeast and poured them into the bucket. Snapped the lid on, forced the airlock in place (filled with vodka (since I’m still out of sanitized water)) and moved the bucket into our storage room, to rest for two weeks at about 68oF.

![Starting Gravity: 1.042][4]

Now I took a moment to test the gravity of what I had boiled. Turns out that it is 1.042 at 72.6oF, or 1.043 after compensating for temperature. According to the [Irish Red Ale](http://www.midwestsupplies.com/irish-red-ale.html) recipe my target was between 1.042 and 1.046, so: so far so good. All I have to do now is leave it alone for the next 2 weeks to let the little yeasties do their terribly important job.

I will update you all on my progress as it progresses. Oh, and check back in a day or two, I took some pictures during the process, and will add them to this post when I get a chance.
