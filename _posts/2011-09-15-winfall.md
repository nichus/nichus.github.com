For the past few months, I’ve been pondering picking up some cigars and spending some time reflecting on our porch. As such, I started reading some blogs on the subject (as I am wont to do, I always research mundane life details before stabbing out on my own), found the [cigars](http://reddit.com/r/cigars) subreddit, also some lovely reviews posted rather frequently by [Zack the Stogie Man](http://zackthestogieman.blogspot.com/) neither of which seemed to be decreasing my desire to inhale.

As luck would have it, I received word of a contest celebrating the first anniversary of [Good Fellas Cigars](http://www.goodfellascigars.com/) was wrapping up last weekend. So I took the opportunity to check out their website, and get myself registered. As is expected, I figured that the chances of me actually winning something are slim to none, so I didn’t think too much more about it, but continued to read up and debate on whether I would be taking the plunge into cigar-land any time soon.

Well, this time fate apparently had other plans and I managed to win the third place prize in their giveaway. Color me suprised! Now, I just have to wait to figure out what sort of cigar goody or goodies I might find myself the proud owner of.

Can’t wait to find out. Thanks in advance Good Fellas, can’t wait to see what it is!
